*	Code and model data availability
The simulation codes and model data for the offshore wind turbine system in this work are open-source and can be found at https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast (wind turbine simulation tool: OpenFAST v3.5.5), https://github.com/NREL/ROSCO (NREL's Reference OpenSource Controller: ROSCO) and https://github.com/OpenFAST/r-test (Test 19 for the OC3 Monopile model: 5MW_OC3Mnpl_DLL_WTurb_WavesIrr). The involved blade structural model including 3D and 1D input files for ANSYS and two modules of OpenFAST (ElastoDyn and BeamDyn) are publicly available at https://github.com/BaoxuanWang/Blade-structural-model or https://git.zju.edu.cn/12112050/blade-structure-model, so as to enable interested readers to reproduce the findings and conduct further innovative research. Moreover, desired code and technical details may be made available on reasonable request.
